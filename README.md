Good Happens is a website designed to remind people of the happiness in our world. Anytime anyone is hysterically laughing, feeling loved, or simply in a great mood, they would go to the webpage and click on the appropriate emoji. From there they might go on to see data on how many people are or have been in similar moods over the past day, week, month, or year.

Enjoy!
